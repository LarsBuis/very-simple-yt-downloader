# Hello, folks! <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MartinHeinz/MartinHeinz/master/wave.gif" width="30px">
I've created this very simple python program to download videos or only the audio from a video on YouTube.

# How to build this project
First you'll have to install Pyinstaller
`pip install pyinstaller`

Then use this command
`pyinstaller "insertscriptname".py --onefile`

And it's built!
